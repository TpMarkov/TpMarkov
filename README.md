I'm a passionate junior web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a growing skillset in modern frameworks like React and tools like Firebase, MongoDB, and Express.

After completing the **Alpha JavaScript Track at Telerik Academy**, I gained real-world experience through several team projects that simulate real development environments. My focus is on building responsive, user-centric applications with clean code and collaborative teamwork.
